  // FRIENDS & FAMILY PICKS
  // Add entries here when someone actually suggests something. For pins
  // already on the map, just add `suggested: true` (and optionally
  // `suggestedBy: 'name'`) to that pin and it'll get a gold star badge.
  // For new spots, add a pin with `category: 'suggested'`.

  // MY FAVORITES
  // Personal favorites are flagged with `favorite: true` on any existing
  // pin. They get a red heart badge on the map and in the list view —
  // separate from the gold star (friends & family) so you can tell who
  // recommended what.

  // PERSONAL NOTES
  // Add `note: 'free text'` to any pin to attach a personal observation
  // that's not a "favorite" flag. Notes show as a yellow sticky-note
  // call-out in the popup, modal, and list view. Useful for opinions
  // like "looks easy but might be a good warmup" — separate from the
  // editorial `tips` array (which is general field advice).

  // DANGER / SKULL & CROSSBONES
  // Add `danger: true` to any pin to put a black skull badge on the
  // map pin and a "USE EXTREME CAUTION" warning in the popup and modal.
  // Use for trails with real consequences (cliff exposure, no bailout,
  // expert-only).
